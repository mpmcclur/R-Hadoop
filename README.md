# R-Hadoop Repository
Methods and example code for interfacing R and Hadoop are presented here. The install files are for general use but pertain to Ubuntu 18.04 specifically. For the examples, Prajapati's "Big Data Analytics with R and Hadoop" is used as a guide. I made minor alterations/corrections to the code as necessary to work with my own datasets. R-Hadoop interfacing has fallen by the wayside since 2014, but it still offers efficient methods to examine large, complex, dynamic datasets outside a cloud environment.
